            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoted From Page <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design">Interaction Design.org</a> Graphic design is a craft 
                where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet 
                users specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience. graphic designers working in user experience (UX) 
                design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach. With user psychology in mind, it's important to stay focused on some very important graphic design considerations,
                namely:</p>

            <p>Apart from considering aspects or guidelines in graphic design, the types of graphic designs that are usually applied by
            several designers are :</p>

                <div class="description-content">
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Web design is a Web development process for creating a website that focuses on aesthetic factors like layout, user
                        interface and other visual imagery in order to make the website more visually appealing and easy to use. Web design makes use of various 
                        programs and tools in order to achieve the intended look, such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop and many others. In order to create a winning design, 
                        Web designers need to think about their audience, the purpose of the website and the visual appeal of the design.</p>

                <li class="list-description-configuration"><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design">User experience (UX) Design</a></li>
                <div class="description-content">
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and
                        relevant experiences to users. UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product,
                        including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. Designing an experience includes not only making the software easy to use but also designing the other experiences
                        related to the product, for example, the marketing campaign, the packaging and after-sales support. Most importantly, UX
                        design is concerned with delivering solutions that address pain points and needs. After all, no one will use a product
                        that serves no purpose.</p>

                <div class="description-content">
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Motion graphics designers, sometimes just called motion designers, create artwork for the web, television or film. This
                    could include movie clips, trailers, commercials, title sequences, etc. They use visual effects, animation and other
                    cinematic techniques to bring life to their creations. They design graphics that are in motion—just as their title
                    suggests. By animating graphics and creating vivid visual effects, motion graphics designers bring films, websites, commercials,
                    and more to an entirely new level. With the increasing prevalence of video content online, a motion graphics designer
                    could find themselves working on almost anything, on any digital platform.
