                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoted From Page <a href="https://www.jagoanhosting.com/blog/mikrotik-adalah/">JagoanHosting.com</a> Mikrotik Mikrotik is an operating system based on RouterOS that makes it easier for users to use internet services from any
                device, such as in an internet cafe. Here, the computer acts as a router for a network. Inside the router, the computer can also include many features such as IP Network wireless networks, internet cafe
                providers, and hotspots. So, it can be said that Mikrotik is an operating system that really helps users. Mikrotik is a system specifically designed to facilitate various computer network needs. For example, designing and
                building a computer network system for large or small scale. The Software <a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox">Winbox</a> is a small utility that allows administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI. It is a native Win32 binary, but can be run on Linux and MacOS (OSX) using Wine. 
                All Winbox interface functions are as close as possible mirroring the console functions, that is why there are no Winbox sections in the manual. Some of advanced and system critical configurations are not possible from winbox, 
                like MAC address change on an interface Winbox changelog. Some features that are often used in Mikrotik Routerboard are:</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLAN, which stands for Local Area Network (LAN), is a computer network that covers a local area only. The point
                                    is, this network can only be used by users in the LAN area. LAN connects devices to the internet via a simple network
                                    device.

                                    This LAN network usually has cables such as UTP, Hub, Switch, or Router. An example of this network is a network
                                    of computers in schools, companies, or internet cafes (cafe). This network has a limited area that is usually a LAN
                                    network. So, the LAN network has a small scale (local).

                                    LAN networks are usually used to share resources within a building. LAN can stand alone, without being connected
                                    by an external network or the internet. However, if a LAN is connected to several other LANs, a new network will be
                                    formed, which is referred to as a <b><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-metropolitan-area-network/">Metropolitan

                                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWireless is a network that connects telecommunications devices to one another without using cables as the medium
                                        of delivery. Instead, the wireless network used is a transmission medium to deliver electromagnetic waves.

                                        If a computer network requires network cables such as optical, fiber, and UTP cables, wireless wireless networks
                                        only use electromagnetic waves to transmit signals from one device to another.

                                    is suitable for those of you who are often outside the network but want to still be able to monitor your network. Apart
                                    from the MikroTik router, Remote VPN can also be used to monitor the underlying devices such as routers or access

                                    the other experiences related to the product, for example, the marketing campaign, the packaging and after-sales support. Most importantly, UX
                                    design is concerned with delivering solutions that address pain points and needs. After all, no one will use a product

                        networking company best known as a manufacturer and vendor of networking equipment. The company also provides software and offers related services. Over its history, 
                        Cisco has focused on Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking technologies, routing and switching products and technology for home networking, IP telephony,
                        optical networking, security, storage area networking and wireless technology.
                    
                        Sandy Lerner and her husband Len Bosack founded Cisco in 1984. At that time, Bosack managed the computers in Stanford University computer science department and Lerner 
                        did the same job at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Bosack and Kirk Lougheed developed Cisco first product, the AGS router, while still at Stanford. In contrast to 
                        the proxy, which can be configured via software or webfig, Cisco devices use the operating system to perform a configuration on the device and the configuration is carried out 
                        on a command line interface. Some of the operating systems used to configure Cisco hardware are:</p>

                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCisco serves as a bridge between two or more networks to pass data from one network to another as well as Mikrotik. The
                        difference here is that Mikrotik is used for small-scale networks, while Cisco is used for large-scale networks. Of
                        course all of that is adjusted to the specifications rather than the device itself.When viewed in terms of price, the cheapest Cisco 
                        routerboard costs around 1-2 billion US dollars, while the most expensive Mikrotik router itself ranges from 1-1.5 million US dollars. 
                        Meanwhile, when viewed from its use, Mikrotik is usually used on a small scale and medium scale (eg school or office buildings). Meanwhile, 
                        enterprises and ISP (internet service providers) use the Cisco brand more.</p>
