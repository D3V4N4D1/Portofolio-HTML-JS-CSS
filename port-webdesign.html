            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoted From Page <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/web-design#:~:text=Web%20design%20refers%20to%20the,development%20rather%20than%20software%20development.">Interaction Design.org</a> 
                Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, 
                in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits 
                the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designers output is a 
                site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.
                
                Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the
                website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Apart from using the <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">Freepik</a> platform, you can use <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for beginners and the <a href="https://id.wix.com/">Wix</a> website as well. What some people
            often use is a website called canva which has the same principle as Freepik, except that <a href="https://canva.com/">Canva</a> has a small resource size compared to the large Freepik.The following is a display of several websites other than Freepik that you can use to create a web design with the
            obligation to collect several licenses, namely:</p>
