            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Quoted From Page <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/photographer/#what-is-a-photographer">Careerxplorer.com</a> Photographers tell stories through images they capture through their cameras. They express their personalities and
            viewpoints through their art. There are a variety of photography niches that photographers can showcase their artistic ability with, such as fashion,
            studio work, travel, journalism, or nature.A photographer typically works in a freelance capacity, and is hired for specific jobs by a variety of clients. A
            part-time/freelance photographer hired by a client is responsible for following the client's wishes down to the finest
            details, as well as for setting up a business model that makes pricing and options clearly visible and accessible.
            
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Photographers are responsible for the digital or physical development of their images, and may also be responsible for
            some or all of the editing. The editing process may include simple cropping, adding/changing colors and shading,
            adjusting sharpness and lighting, or removing objects to clean the image up. There are many genres of photography one can specialize in, such as:

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mastering your camera settings and understanding concepts like aperture and shutter speed is crucial for anyone looking
            to improve their photography skills. But the truth is that the most important aspects of photography actually have
            little to do with the camera itself. Composition is a good example of this, because understanding how to compose a photograph will help you produce stronger
            images whether you are shooting with a DSLR or your camera phone. Quoted From Page <a href="https://www.bobbooks.co.uk/blog-post/10-compositional-techniques-to-improve-your-photographs">bobbooks.co.uk</a>
